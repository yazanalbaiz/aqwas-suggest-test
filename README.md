This repo is for my development test at Aqwas.

It contains a simple web application using ReactJS and Redux.

The app is for suggesting random restaurants to the user based on his location.

</div>


This is the first view, “Suggest “button should suggest new restaurant to the user.

After clicking suggest button, the user should be moved to this page, which
shows the information of the restaurant in the map.
